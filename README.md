# MalGen

MalGen is a cross-platform malware generator, used to interactively configure and generate malware executables and code snippets on the fly. 

The tool functions in such a way that allows the user to configure multiple options for various techniques like Encryption, Obfuscation, Payload Placement, Injections, etc. Once configured, the tool will compile a binary using semi-hardcoded C snippets reflecting the techniques and options the user selected.

More documentation coming soon.
